Doing full-stack on my own can be really challenging sometimes. I have always hated getting any bugs or errors in my code, it is one of the most frustrating things ever when I can't find WHERE the bug is or HOW to fix it. Who can relate to this? 

However, the more I hated this, the less fun coding became for me and I did NOT want to let these silly bugs &amp; errors bring me down. If I made a mistake, then I CAN fix it! If there is a bug, I will LEARN what I should be doing instead moving forward! So, I am making a list of all the mistakes I made and organize the solutions and say HEY YOU SOLVED A PROBLEM! GOOD JOB! Mistakes are good, it's a pathway to make you stronger and better, because you are overcoming a challenge. So, you should feel proud of yourself! It's frustrating, but we can work through how we perceive our frustration into a positive thing, one-by-one. Let's do this!

1. A vista (stack pane) was not coming up when a button leading to this vista was clicked. The console said: javafx.fxml.LoadException: Root hasn't been set. Use method setRoot() before load.

Solution from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21299038/root-hasnt-been-set-error-with-java-8-eclipse: uncheck fx:root construct from Scene Builder-> Document -> Controller, or remove from code of fxml file

Woohoo! Learned one thing to start off the morning!
